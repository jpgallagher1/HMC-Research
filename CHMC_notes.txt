To Do
0) Refactor code ASAP
    - tests.py
        - analytically confirm numerical integration from MC-Research/2025/Fall/integrators.ipynb
        - 
    - metrics.py
    -

Working in cov_plot.ipynb
✓ Making some data from existing HMC sampler
    ✓  Low dim for speed (4, 8, 16)
    ✓  Make `large number' of chains (20 each)
- Metric for chains    
    ✓  Calc cov matrices
    2) 
    3) Metric for a single chain cov matrix
    4) Metric on all chains' cov matrix
    5) Avg Metric on all chains' cov matrix

- Plot cov matrix comparison
    6) Plot avg metric
    7) Plot all chains
    6) Plot avg + shadow chain

Priorities: 
1) Duplicate images from the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06901
    - Covariance: error in covariance is also simplified and computed by taking the l ∞ - norm along the diagonal of the sample covariance matrix.
    - KS Distance
    - W1 Distance
    - Histogram of chain samples?
    - Violin plot of chain samples
